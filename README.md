Introduction

The Ncapture Event Management System was developed to improve and automate event management at NSBM Green University. Traditionally, campus event organization was managed manually with significant inefficiencies such as scheduling conflicts, resource mismanagement, and communication issues. This project addresses these challenges by providing a centralized, web-based platform to streamline event scheduling, resource allocation, communication, and reporting — enhancing the overall university event management experience.

Background, Objectives & Deliverables

Background

Campus events at NSBM include academic seminars, cultural activities, and student engagements crucial to student development and community building. The manual system using emails and Microsoft Forms is prone to double bookings, delayed communication, and high administrative overhead. A digital event management system is needed to:
	•	Automate scheduling and resource management
	•	Provide real-time event status updates
	•	Enhance communication among organizers, participants, and staff
	•	Enable data-driven decisions through reporting

Objectives
	•	Streamline event scheduling and reduce manual errors
	•	Optimize resource utilization (venues, equipment, media personnel)
	•	Improve communication via real-time notifications and updates
	•	Deliver an intuitive, role-based user interface
	•	Ensure system scalability, security, and cross-device accessibility
	•	Support sustainable paperless workflows

Deliverables
	•	Fully functional web-based application
	•	Role-based dashboards and access controls
	•	Automated scheduling and conflict prevention tools
	•	Resource allocation module
	•	Real-time notifications and feedback collection
	•	Analytics dashboard for event performance
	•	User manuals and training materials
	•	Testing and quality assurance documentation
	•	Maintenance and update plan

User Requirements & Data Gathering

User Requirements

Through stakeholder consultation, the following key requirements were identified:
	•	Secure authentication and role management
	•	Comprehensive event lifecycle handling (creation, approval, updates, cancellation)
	•	Efficient resource allocation avoiding conflicts
	•	Real-time communication and notifications
	•	Feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement
	•	Mobile and desktop accessibility with an easy-to-use UI

Data Gathering

A detailed survey was conducted among students, lecturers, media club members, and staff using Google Forms. The survey collected data on:
	•	Frequency and nature of events attended/organized
	•	Pain points in current manual event management
	•	Satisfaction with communication and scheduling
	•	Desired features for a new digital system

Survey results confirmed strong demand for an automated web application and guided design priorities.
